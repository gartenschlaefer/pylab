Augmented Reality - Assignment 1 - Camera Pose Estimation

Task

In this Pose Estimation task a checkerboard was used as marker.
The pipeline mainly follows the tutorial from [1]


--
Camera Calibration

First the camera was calibrated using a checkerboard printed on a paper and sticked to a cardboard.
Here multiple photos from different angles onto the checkerboard were done with a Smartphone.

- The object points of the checkerboard marker were created
- The image points were extracted from the photos -> cv2.findChessboardCorners, and stored to an array 
- using cv2.calibrateCamera, which implements [2], gives back the intrinsic camera parameter as well as the distortion of the lens
- this parameters were save to files

Pose Estimation

- A video with different angles onto the checkerboard was done -> input_video
- Camera Calibration parameters were retrieved from the files

- Each frame of the input_video was read:
-- the key points of the checkerboard were retrieved and refined
-- the PnP-problem was solved with cv2.solvePnPRansac -> translation, rotation onto image space
-- object points of a Christmas tree were projected onto the image plane
-- the Christmas tree was rendered into the frame

- Outputs a wonderful video with a checkerboard and a rendered Christmas Tree onto it.

Conclusion

With the help of the tutorial [1], it was easy to start with this pose estimation task.
The main changes were merely rendering a Christmas Tree 3D object and handling the frames for the video.
The output video shows that the algorithm works in general, but acts weird when the angles change too much and the zero point of the projection jumps somewhere else. 
Also sometime the corners were not found and the Christmas Tree could not be rendered onto it.
Further improvements and probably a better marker, which is not rotation symmetric, should be used, to give a more natural output.
